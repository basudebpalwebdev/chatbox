# chatbox
Test Assignment:

Make a popup chatbox without using any plugin/jQuery. The chatbox needs to slide up (again, without jQuery/jQuery UI/any other plugin) from bottom right, 5 seconds after the user has entered the page. The example popup should have a pane for conversation, a text box for typing and a minimize button. Clicking on the minimize button will minimize the popup, and save the minimized state to cookie. This state must be used next time the user enters the page, i.e. the popup will show as minimized, and an open button will be shown instead of the minimize button. Clicking on the open button will again slide up the popup and save the open state in cookie (hence, next time the popup will slide up maximized again).

Please note that no actual functionality for chat is needed. Just the functionality mentioned above is enough for the demo.

As for inspiration, here's a chat window (It doesn't have to look exactly like the screenshot.):

What we are looking for is clean, cross-browser friendly code that uses vanilla JS. ES6 is preferred, but not necessary.
